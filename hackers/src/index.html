                <p class="hackers-text">Hackers is a 1995 American cyberpunk thriller film directed by Iain Softley and starring Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Renoly Santiago, Matthew Lillard, Lorraine Bracco and Fisher Stevens. The film follows the exploits of a group of gifted high school hackers and their involvement in a corporate extortion conspiracy. Made in the 1990s when the internet was unfamiliar to the general public, it reflects the ideals layed out in the Hacker Manifesto quoted in the film, "This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch [...] We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. [...] Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity." Hackers has achieved cult classic status.</p>
                <p class="hackers-text">In 1988, 11-year old <span class="hackers-zero-cool">Dade "Zero Cool" Murphy</span> is arrested and charged with crashing 1,507 computer systems in a single day and causing a single-day 7-point drop in the New York Stock Exchange. Upon conviction, his family is fined $45,000 for the events, and although he is not convicted, he is banned from owning or operating computers or touch-tone telephones until he is 18 years old.</p>
                <p class="hackers-text">Seven years later, Dade (Jonny Lee Miller), is now living with his mother, who has divorced and moved to New York City. On Dade's 18th birthday, he receives a computer and calls a local television station. Using social engineering dupes the security guard into giving him the modem's phone number and successfully hacks into the station's computer network, changing the current TV program to an episode of The Outer Limits. However, Dade's intrusion is countered by another hacker (handle <b class="hackers-emphasis-bold">"Acid Burn"</b>) on the same network, and they briefly converse. During the exchange, Dade identifies himself by a new alias, Crash Override, rather than reveal himself as <span class="hackers-zero-cool">"Zero Cool"</span>.</p>
                <p class="hackers-text">Dade enrolls at Stuyvesant High School, where he meets Kate Libby (Angelina Jolie), who is assigned to take him on a tour of the school. After pranking Dade by claiming there's a pool on the roof of the school, only to lock him outside with several other students during a rainstorm, a rift develops between Dade and Kate. Ramon "The Phantom Phreak" Sanchez (Renoly Santiago) observes Dade access the school mainframe during computer class to put himself into the same English class as Kate and invites him to a hacker nightclub, Cyberdelia, where the rivalry between Dade and Kate intensifies as Dade beats Kate's high score in "Wipeout".</p>
