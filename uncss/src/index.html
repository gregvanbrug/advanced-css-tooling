                <p class="css-text">The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain. Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was... He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern California from Redondo to Calabassos. And he was an avid bowler. And a good friend. He died&mdash;he died as so many of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom you took him, Lord. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc.</p>
                <p class="css-text">And let's also not forget&mdash;let's not forget, <span class="css-the-dude">Dude</span>&mdash;that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for domestic, you know, within the city &mdash;that isn't legal either. Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. <b class="css-emphasis-bold">NOTHING IS FUCKED?! THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!</b> What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties? HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! Fucking fascist! Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!</p>
                <p class="css-text">The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight-year-old. Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski! It's all a goddamn fake. Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit. And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say. Blow on them. Whose toe was it, Walter? I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.</p>
                <p class="css-text"><b class="css-emphasis-bold">DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY?</b> Dieter has been on the fringes of &mdash;well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'. Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame. Where's my goddamn money, you bum?! That's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug. Come and get it. Fucking nihilist. Finishing my coffee. Is this your homework, Larry? I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.</p>
                <p class="css-text">Fuck me, man! That kid's already spent all the money! You said it, man. Nobody fucks with the Jesus. That is our most modestly priced receptacle. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. Za, okay, I bring mein toolz. ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that&mdash;quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. <b class="css-emphasis-bold">I FUCK YOU! YOU CANNOT HURT ME! I BELIEF IN NUSSING!</b></p>
