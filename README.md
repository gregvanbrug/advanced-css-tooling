# Advanced CSS Tooling

    Demo files for a presentation

Each directory contains a package.json, Gruntfile, demo src files, and some even a bower.json.

cd into the tool you want to give a spin, npm install (&& optionally bower install), and grunt. Checkout the target/www/assets/css directories to see the output. In the hackers and uncss directories there is an addition grunt dist task that will do some additional processing.
